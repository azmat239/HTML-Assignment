    <h1>Theory Of Computational</h1>
    <p>Automata theory (also known as Theory Of Computation) is a theoretical branch of Computer Science and Mathematics, which mainly deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as automata.</p>
    <p>Automata* enables scientists to understand how machines compute the functions and solve problems. The main motivation behind developing Automata Theory was to develop methods to describe and analyze the dynamic behavior of discrete systems. Automata originated from the word “Automaton” which is closely related to “Automation”.</p>
    <h2>Lecture Notes</h2>
    <p>Not every student can make effective Notes during their Class. To help all such students of B.Tech we have provided the Branch wise Notes of all the departments in an organized way. Those who are good at taking Lecture Notes during the class can score really well. Make use of them during your preparation and score max. marks in the exam. You can download the respective subject notes you want to prepare free of cost through the BTech Geeks quick links available. Click on them and enhance your subject knowledge.</p>
