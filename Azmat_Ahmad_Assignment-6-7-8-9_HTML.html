        In computer science we study the each and every aspect of computer and how work computer and programming of
        computer application and working of computer.
        As the name suggests, this is a study that encompasses the theory of computation and the design and
        implementation of computational systems.
        This is a course which is offered all over the globe in the best of the technical institutions and a student can
        do graduation as well as post-graduation degrees.As part of the programme, students get to learn about
        developing hardware as well as software systems for the computers and they also gain ample knowledge over the
        communication systems and other similar devices. This is also one of the reasons why computer science graduatesare best suited for robotics research.</font>
        <p><font size="3" color="green" face="Wildwest">The field of CS has some of the greatest advantages like having great pay, innovative and challenging working
         Computer science & engineering is a branch of computer related study and computer science is the study of
            patterns, and constantly learning new things.
            
        But like every other stream, there are several cons as well, like the work can be monotonous sometimes, and all
        other times there can be long and tiring hours of work. CS is one of those without which the world of academics
        and industry would have crashed down. Needless to say, it is very popular among youngsters.</font></p>
